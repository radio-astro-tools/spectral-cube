Spectral Cube documentation
===========================

The ``spectral-cube`` package provides an easy way to read, manipulate,
analyze, and write data cubes with two positional dimensions and one
spectral dimension, optionally with Stokes parameters.

``spectral-cube`` aims to be a versatile data container for building
custom analysis routines. It provides the following main features:

- A uniform interface to spectral cubes, robust to the
  wide range of conventions of axis order, spatial projections,
  and spectral units that exist in the wild.
- Easy extraction of cube sub-regions using physical coordinates.
- Ability to easily create, combine, and apply masks to datasets.
- Basic summary statistic methods like moments and array aggregates.
- Designed to work with datasets too large to load into memory.

Quick start
-----------

Here's a simple script demonstrating ``spectral-cube``::

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from spectral_cube import SpectralCube
    >>> cube = SpectralCube.read('data.fits')
    >>> print cube
    SpectralCube with shape=(563, 640, 640) and unit=K:
    n_x: 640  type_x: RA---SIN  unit_x: deg
    n_y: 640  type_y: DEC--SIN  unit_y: deg
    n_s: 563  type_s: FREQ      unit_s: Hz

    # extract the subcube between 98 and 100 GHz
    >>> slab = cube.spectral_slab(98 * u.GHz, 100 * u.GHz)

    # Ignore elements fainter than 1K
    >>> masked_slab = slab.with_mask(slab > 1)

    # Compute the first moment and write to file
    >>> m1 = masked_slab.moment(order=1)
    >>> m1.write('moment_1.fits')

Using ``spectral-cube``
-----------------------

The package centers around the
:class:`~spectral_cube.SpectralCube` class. In the following
sections, we look at how to read data into this class, manipulate spectral
cubes, extract moment maps or subsets of spectral cubes, and write spectral
cubes to files.
