0.6.1.dev (unreleased)
----------------------
- Fix memory issue when calling statistics() on FITS cubes. #752
- Replace deprecated and insecure `mktemp` with `TemporaryDirectory` for
  ``save_to_tmp_dir`` and add custom deletor to ensure cleanup. #796

0.6 (2021-09-30)
----------------
- Fix `convolve_to` when units are in Jy/beam. Add error/warnings for operations
  for all operations that change the spatial resolution for Jy/beam cubes.
- Add ``argmax_world`` and ``argmin_world`` to return the argmin/max position
  in WCS coordinates. This is ONLY defined for independent WCS axes
  (e.g., spectral) #680
- Bugfix: subcube producing spatial offsets for large images #666
- Switch to using standalone casa-formats-io package for reading in CASA
  .image files (this was split out from spectral-cube). #684
- Make it possible to customize ``target_chunksize`` in the CASA reader. #705

0.5 (2020-09-17)
----------------

- Switch to using unified I/O infrastructure from Astropy. #600
- Bugfix: fix slicing of cubes with mask set to None. #621

  can now be read without CASA installed. #607, #609, #613
- Add new dask-friendly classes ``DaskSpectralCube`` and
  ``DaskVaryingResolutionSpectralCube`` which use dask to efficiently
  carry out calculations. #618

  several global statistics to be computed by loading each cube chunk
  only once. #663
